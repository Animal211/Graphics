=== Linux installation instructions ===

For the general idea of how to install this software, review the top
of README.txt first.

If you are not on a Michigan Tech administered Linux lab computer, you
will need to install the libraries. To install them on Ubuntu 18.04, try:

apt install cmake make gcc imagemagick libmagickcore-dev assimp-utils
libassimp4 libassimp-dev libglfw3 libglfw3-dev glew-utils libglew2.0
libglew-dev xorg libxinerama-dev libxcursor-dev libxi-dev

The above command assumes that you are using X instead of Wayland for
graphics. For alternative ways to install these packages, look at the
files in this folder for each of the individual libraries.

Once the libraries are installed, go into the opengl-examples folder and run:

cmake .

If there are error messages, then need to work to resolve them. If you
don't have assimp installed, you will get a warning message and some
of the programs will not compile (but some will).

If cmake was successful, run the following to compile the programs:

make


To run a program, try:

cd bin
./triangle


If you encounter strange issues with cmake, try running:

./cleanup.sh
cmake .
make
cd bin
./triangle

(The cleanup.sh script will delete any extra cache files that cmake
creates/uses).
